## Server-Side APIs Challenge: Weather Dashboard (Module 6)
The purpose of this challenge was to create a page that displays current and futre weather data.

## Installation:
In order to access the files needed to complete the challenge see: https://github.com/BrennanJLM/weather-dashboard and clone either the following HTTPS link or SSH key:
HTTPS Link: https://github.com/BrennanJLM/weather-dashboard.git
SSH Key: git@github.com:BrennanJLM/password-generator.git
In order to clone the project to a "projects" directory, open your terminal (mac) or gitbash (windows) window and type the following commands into your terminal/gitbash command line:
1 - mkdir projects
2 - cd ./projects (You can use the command "pwd" to ensure you are in the correct directory)
3 - git clone <HTTPS link> OR git clone <SSH Key>
4 - ls (this will list all of the files now inside of the current directory)
Open your coding software, select "open file" and locate the module-3-challenge file in your projects directory OR find the correct file in your directory and "Open With" your coding software.

## Usage
- This website's main purpose is to serve as a tool for users to use to display current weather conditions and forecasts for desired cities. The user will:
- Type desired city into the search form and hit the submit button
- The page will then display current weather and a 5 day forecast for entered city
- The current forecast displays temperature, wind speed, humidity and the UV index
- The UV index is color coordinated to whether conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
- The five day forecast displays the date, the weather icon associated with the weather expected, temperature, wind speed and humidity
- Below the search field will be a list of previous searched cities
- The user is able to click on a previous serched city to search, opposed to typing the city name back in
- The city searches are saved locally
